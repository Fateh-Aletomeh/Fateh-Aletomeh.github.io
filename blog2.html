      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>This is the second blog post. Replace this content with your own writing. You can add as many paragraphs, headings, and sections as you need.</p>
        
        <p>The minimalist design focuses on readability and clean presentation of your content. Feel free to structure your posts however you like.</p>
        
        <h2>Your First Section</h2>
        
        <p>Add your content here. The typography and spacing have been carefully chosen to make your writing easy to read and pleasant to look at.</p>
        
        <p>You can continue writing naturally, and the design will take care of itself. The focus is on your words, not on distracting design elements.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Second Section</h2>
        
        <p>Keep adding sections as needed. The template is flexible enough to accommodate short posts or longer, more detailed articles.</p>
        
        <p>Remember to update the title, date, and all content to match your actual blog post. This is just a template to get you started.</p>
