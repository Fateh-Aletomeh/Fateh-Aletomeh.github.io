      <h1>Working on the code</h1>
      <p class="blog-date">January 18, 2026</p>
      
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p>We decided to spend Christmas writing the code from scratch to make the code readable, scalable and secure (and we finally gained access to Cisco's system!).</p>
                
        <h2>The process</h2>
        
        <p>We decided to first built a fully functional version of the project without multiple agents first so that we can better understand how the code will work, and we will use LangChain to make it multiagent in the coming weeks.</p>
        
        <p>We split the workload between the four of us so we could each focus on one part of the workflow. We agreed on rules for writing the code, such as making sure we use type hinting everywhere, following the PEP8 format, and using OOP principles.</p>
        
        <p>Progress is slow since we have not been able to test out the Microsoft Graph API due to lack of permissions at the moment, but we are slowly adding more code and, so far, we have added the ability to read multiple people's calendars, book meetings, allow the user to communicate with the bot on Webex, and natural language processing with OpenAI API.</p>
        
        <h2>Cisco updates</h2>
        
        <p>With regards to Cisco, we are now fully onboarded and have gained access to a Cloud PC that allows us to connect to the Azure directory with our Cisco accounts. We are going to meet up with Sunny on Tuesday to get access to the OpenAI API keys and to catch up with her.</p>

        <h2>Future plans</h2>
        
        <p>Over the next 2 weeks, we plan to finish the basic version of the code (i.e. not multiagent) and test it to make sure it is working, before we move on to making the project multiagent and incorporate user preferences into the decision making of when to book meetings.</p>
